# ROADMAP!
**Due: Apr 15th**
which is insane
but
I hope I can do it...
if not then I'll just spend 5 hours of my life making a Scratch game cuz I still have to finish this ðŸ˜­

## The Enhancement Utility
Since Pyxel <s>can be</s> is confusing <sub>(for me who can only understand something when learning something visual but anyways enough about me uh)</sub>, I made some wrappers and other utilities that helps me. +makes everything a lot more neat.

I might release this as a separate project and continue to maintain it...

I don't know, I'm not even sure if brain capability is enough for that. Or maybe nobody needs it anyway because I can't find ANY GOOD RESOURCE ABOUT PYXEL DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE PROJECT PAGE HAS OVER 11k STARS.
